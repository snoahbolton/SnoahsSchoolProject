        Signup for an encrypted email account (<a class="blog-link" href="https://tutanota.com/" target="_blank">Tutanota</a> is free)
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">

      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Work to deactivate, distance and delete as much as you can from companies with poor privacy track records&#59; namely Google, Microsoft and Meta.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Understand that these companies and others like them (Amazon, TikTok, Snapchat, etc.) have become part of our world now. Living completely privately from these companies is hard, unpleasant and may not be worth it for you.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-postscript">
        P.S. It's okay if something is not worth it for you.
