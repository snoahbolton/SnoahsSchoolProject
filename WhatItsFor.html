        This hub exists to serve as a guide for those
         interested in privacy respecting search engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have included links to multiple levels of private search engines
        on the home page along with a comparison of those search engines, 
        how to set up your own private search engine, and a small privacy
        focused blog with more general information. If you have any questions
        or would like to contact me, please checkout the "About the Creator" link 
        at the bottom of the page
